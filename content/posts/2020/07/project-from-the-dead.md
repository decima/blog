In 2011, I learned a very important rule about myself:
> When you have an idea after 2AM, it's most of the time a bad idea.

Sometimes you want to listen one song, and at 2AM, you download all the artist's discography. 

For some groups like Queen, it's a wonderful thing, but globally, 
when the song is [Hurt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AHCfZTRGiI) from Johnny Cash, then you have on your computer
an awesome treasure of a 1000 country songs, 1/20 of my whole music library. 

But the same year, I had another idea, and let's talk about it.

## Seeds of an idea

Back in 2011, was in my room, without anything to do, anything to see, bored to hell, in Coventry, UK.
I wanted to go out, going to a concert, but didn't know where to search this.So,
  used the best search engine in the world, A.K.A. Google,  for events tonight in my city, and because Google is awesome, the first two results:
- London - 1 hour by train
- Manchester - 2 hours by train

Don't know about Charlie, the unicorn? take some time procrastinating on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsGYh8AacgY&list=PL94555807213983FB&index=4)

Seriously? This was a deception. So I gave up and started watching Doctor Who - awesome tv show btw.

The next day, for an acquaintance, I searched in Ottawa - Canada, a classical music concert, the same way. 
That's cool because Ottawa's bigger than Coventry, so I was sure I would find what I was searching for.
The nearest concert aired 6 months later. 

Often, ideas arise to solve a problem that you meet. You're a knight who wants to get laid with the princess, but 
the highest tower guarded by a dragon. To solve your problem, you'll have to fight the dragon. But don't worry, the princess is in another castle :cry:

And this is how **Nearme** arose in my mind. A simple but powerful search engine for events based on the user's location in time and space. 

## Cool story, bro.
Ok, I'm pretty sure you're asking why for god's sake I'm talking about an old project, and you are right. Why do I talk about this? 

My life gave me the opportunity to develop a project, and maybe make it a company, earn money and so on, and this is the moment. 

So, I'm resurrecting an idea that never left me, and I wanted to share it with you my dear reader. 


Now, 1AM, going to sleep before having another idea.
