Let's talk about this sh*t named covid-19. 

In France, quarantine begun on March 16 and ended on June 2nd, for a 2.5 months.

During this time, my friends and I thought it would be a great idea to start role playing.

So I suggested myself as a Dungeon Master, and now we play about every week/two weeks. 

### Previously

We started to play tabletop RPGs during 2018. With the full team, we were all beginners and no one ever played 
to RPG in their entire life. 

This was a good start, a good first impression, and due to the lack of time, we played at most 4 times.

### Covid rolls the dice

Due to quarantine, we had nothing to do unless playing so we started to play online with [roll20](https://roll20.net),
a *webRTC* platform for RPG Gaming.

We started our playing sessions on already drafted scenarios, and the first one we played was 
[this ready to play Scenario](https://www.orbe.be/scenarios/pret-a-jouer/100-hm-307) offered by a belgium team
[Le collectif de l'orbe](https://www.orbe.be/).


This was kind of fun, and I like to be DM. You know the story, your players don't. 
You choose what they do but you leave them the impression that they make the choice.
Like little puppets? kind of :-)

But the more you play, the more you understand that you cannot decide for them, 
you can try to think of everything they can do, but be sure that they'll surely try an unpredictable move.

### Covid Fumbles

We decided to start a full campaign - [*Le monde de Rayhana*](https://valrod.pagesperso-orange.fr/athala/revelation/rayhana.htm) (Rayhana's world), 
written for [Athala](http://www.athala.org/) but not updated since 2014. 

It's a complete universe, with a 60M years' story, religions, cities, politics, 
and all what I need to give my story a good background.

So the team started and for nearly once a week,
