In a recent tabletop RPG game using the [Basic Role Playing system](https://www.chaosium.com/brp-system-reference-document/), 
my players met Tom, a weird wizard in a weird shop. 

In their first encounter, The wizard sold them a mysterious key chain of ten keys and told them that these keys can open doors worldwide.

I made a simple rule for this key chain : 

Every time you need to open a door you can use one of your keys. You roll 1D10 <= the number of keys left. 

For example, the first time the player wants to try to open the door with
the key, he has 100% chances to make it work. Once the door is open, 
the player cannot use the key for another door. Completely gone for ever.

The second time a player will try to open another door, with one of his 9 keys,
he has to roll 1d10 and make 9 or less, which gives him 90% chances that the key match the lock.

If the roll fails, the player doesn't lose his key.

With 5 keys, he has still 50% chances of success, and with the last key, he has only 10% chances of success. 

I think this mechanic is interesting as the player has to decide when and where to use his keys, 
but in the same time, it can be tricky for the DM if the quest is to find a key to open a door.

I'll try to share with you other game mechanics.
