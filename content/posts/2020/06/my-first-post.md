> This is my first post. 
>> Again.

Don't know how many blogs I've started. In fact more than you would figuring out. 
From my first "Skyblog", to now, maybe 7? 8? Even I don't know. 
But that's good, learning from my mistakes, from my abandoned children.

Now, new start ! And because of this new start, I have to define the purpose of this blog.

Thinking about this blog for months, I think I want to share what I like, coding, cinema, role playing games, and a lot 
more. 

So that was the easiest part! now let's begin of I'll drop this blog even before publishing it.
